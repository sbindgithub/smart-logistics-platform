The goal is to build a **scalable, modular, and observable logistics system** that reflects modern software engineering standards:

- Clean architecture and clear service boundaries  
- Event-driven communication  
- Secure, API-first design  
- Cloud-ready and DevOps-friendly  

This repository focuses not only on *what* is built, but *how* and *why* it is built.
