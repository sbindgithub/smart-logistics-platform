# 🚀 Smart Logistics Platform

A **cloud-native, event-driven logistics platform** built with **ASP.NET Core** to manage **orders, inventory, shipments, and real-time tracking** using modern enterprise architecture and DevOps practices.

This project is designed as a **career-grade portfolio** demonstrating how large-scale systems are planned, structured, and built in real-world enterprises.

---

## 📌 Project Vision

The goal is to build a **scalable, modular, and observable logistics system** that reflects modern software engineering standards:

- Clean architecture and clear service boundaries  
- Event-driven communication  
- Secure, API-first design  
- Cloud-ready and DevOps-friendly  

This repository focuses not only on *what* is built, but *how* and *why* it is built.
